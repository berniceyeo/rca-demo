        * Bootstrap Grid System -> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/
        1. Each row will contain one or more columns. Just like each section of a website. 
        2. Bootstrap uses a 12 column system - meaning each row is divided into 12 "sections"
        3. Each column can take up a number of "sections". But the sum must not exceed 12. 
           Otherwise the items that cannot fit into the column. ie. Try to change line 59 to col-6, and line 79 to col-3. And see what happens
        4. If the sum of the column sections exceed 12 (ie. col-6, col-4, col-4). The last column will be pushed down to the next line. TRY IT :)

        * On "row-cols-[number]"
        1. This specifies how many columns a row can have
        2. If the number is 3 (row-cols-3), this means if the row has 5 columns like below, there will be two rows of 3 columns and 2 columns.
        3. Structurally wise, all 5 columns will be in the same row, just think of it has having a line break.
